The objective of [Fair Elections Estonia](https://ariregister.rik.ee/eng/company/80339095/) is to ensure free and democratic elections in the Republic of Estonia, for which the ascertaining of the results is fair and observable, while keeping content of the ballot private to each voter.

In pursuit of this objective, we gather and share the expertise of both local and international election observers, support and advocate for election observers in safeguarding their common interests, and invite everybody committed to the integrity of democratic elections to join us in our efforts.
